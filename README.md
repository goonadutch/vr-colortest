# Color Blindness Detection using A-Frame

### Virtual reality-based color blindness assessment providing accurate results, empowering easy self-detection without specialized equipment or clinic visits.
This project aims to detect color blindness using WebXR technology combined with A-Frame framework and Ishihara test plates. Color blindness, or color vision deficiency, is a condition that affects a person's ability to perceive colors accurately. By utilizing immersive web technologies, this project offers a novel approach to assess color vision deficiency in users.

### Features:
#### Two-Stage Assessment:
**Stage 1:**  Users are presented with a virtual environment featuring a tree with red and green apples. They are instructed to select only the red apples. Failure to do so prompts users to seek medical advice.

**Stage 2:**  If users successfully identify the red apples, they proceed to the Ishihara test plates. These plates contain numbers hidden within colored patterns, and users are asked to identify them.  The choices made by users determine the type of color blindness they may have.
